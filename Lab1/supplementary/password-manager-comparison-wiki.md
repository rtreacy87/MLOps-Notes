## Pass (Unix Password Manager)

### Multi-device Synchronization
Pass uses Git for synchronization, allowing you to push and pull your encrypted password store between devices.

```bash
# Initialize Git repository
pass git init

# Add a remote repository
pass git remote add origin git@github.com:username/password-store.git

# Push your passwords to the remote repository
pass git push -u origin main  # or 'master' for older Git versions
```

### Mobile Support
- **Android**: [Password Store](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store)
- **iOS**: [Pass for iOS](https://github.com/mssun/passforios)

Both apps support Git synchronization and GPG key management.

### Browser Integration
- **Firefox/Chrome**: [browserpass](https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-extension)
- **Setup**:
  ```bash
  # Install native host application
  brew install browserpass  # macOS
  sudo apt install browserpass  # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```

### API Key Storage
Pass excels at storing API keys and other structured data:

```bash
# Store an API key
pass insert api/aws/access-key

# Store multiline JSON configuration
pass insert -m api/gcp/service-account
# Paste JSON content and press Ctrl+D

# Retrieve for use in scripts
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=$(pass api/aws/access-key)
```

### Infrastructure as Code Integration
Pass works well with IaC through its command-line interface:

```bash
# In a Terraform script
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  # Use pass to retrieve a secret
  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "API_KEY=${pass api/service/key}" > /etc/environment
  EOF
}
```

### Strengths
