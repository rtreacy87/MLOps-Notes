# Azure MLOps Engineer Command-Line Guide

Welcome to the Azure MLOps Engineer Command-Line Guide! This repository contains practical guides and tutorials for MLOps engineers working with Azure Machine Learning services. The focus is on command-line tools and workflows to help you become productive quickly.

## Purpose

This guide is designed for new MLOps engineers who need to:
- Set up and configure Azure ML environments
- Manage data and models through the command line
- Build and deploy ML pipelines
- Monitor and maintain ML systems in production
- Implement MLOps best practices on Azure

## Getting Started

Before diving into specific topics, make sure you have:
1. An Azure account with appropriate permissions
2. Azure CLI installed on your machine
3. Azure ML CLI extension installed
4. Python environment set up for Azure ML SDK

See our [Environment Setup Wiki](wiki/environment-setup.md) for detailed instructions.
